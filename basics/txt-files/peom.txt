The Garden's Grace

Upon the morn, when light did break,
The tender dew did softly wake,
And in the glade, where flowers bloom,
A scented breeze dispels the gloom.

The roses blush, the lilies stand,
Their petals kissed by Nature's hand.
The ivy climbs, the fountains play,
And golden beams do kiss the day.

Yet fleeting is this peaceful grace,
For time, like shadows, doth erase.
But in the heart, the memory lies,
Of beauty caught 'neath starlit skies.
